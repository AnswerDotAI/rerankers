    "Cross-encoders, on the other hand, take in **both** a query and a document as input, and output a score rather than a representation. This is the basic logic behind all \"reranker\" model approaches: they're aware of the full content of both a target document and a query at inference time, which means they can take subtle interactions into account.  \n",
